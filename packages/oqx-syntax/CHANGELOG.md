## [0.2.3] - 2026-10-09

### Patch
- **OQX 0.16 — the AST is a first-class contract** (`spec/oqx/AST.md`, fixtures `cases/ast.json` + `cases/ast-spans.json`, 70 new cases; 959 in all). Both engines now produce one normalized tree a tool can reflect on without re-parsing:

  - **Spans on every node**: `span: [start, end)` in Unicode code points over the raw source (a template's `rawSource`, where a binding occupies its `${n}` marker). The TypeScript lexer counted UTF-16 units; it now counts code points like the Rust one, so the `(at offset N)` of a lex/parse error is the same number in both engines. `toUtf16(span, source)` converts for editors.
  - **Normalized shape**: `kind` on every node (`query`, `subquery`, `follow`, `order` added), optionals materialized (`where`/`limit`/`offset`/`countCmp: null`, `distinct`/`values: false`), operators and consumers serialized as their source words, the never-produced `Expr.index` variant removed. `toJSON(query)` / `ast_to_json(&query)` emit `{ "oqx": "0.16", "kind": "query", … }`; the Rust crate derives serde under the `json` feature (`query_from_json` reads it back).
  - **`where` keeps its surface form**: the parser no longer inlines `select` aliases into `where` (it only validates them — every `errors-parse` fixture is unchanged); the substitution is the exported pure `resolveAliases` / `resolve_aliases`, applied exactly once by the run entry points (`oqx`, `run`, `execute`, `runQuery`; `run_query`, `execute`). **An `Engine.run` now evaluates the query it is given** — code that drives `InMemoryEngine`/`PlannedEngine` directly with a query whose `where` uses aliases must resolve first (resolution is not idempotent: `name: name.upper() … where name`).
  - **Traversal**: `visit(root, { enter, leave })` with `{ path, clause, depth }` (scope depth, 0 = root) and `transform(root, f)`, both driven by one child-key table (`CHILDREN`; Rust `walk::visit`/`transform` with a `Visitor` trait, `Node`, `Clause`); `stripSpans` / `strip_spans`; builders `build.*` / `oqx::build::*` for hand-made nodes (empty span `[0, 0]`).
  - **Canonical printer**: `print(node)` / `print_query` — single spaces, `select` written at the top level, every item aliased, double-quoted strings, minimal parentheses from the precedence table; `printTemplate` → `{ strings, count, indices }` for a tree with bindings (`print` throws, new error stage `print`). Law, enforced by both spec runners over every fixture query: `strip(parse(print(parse(q)))) ≡ strip(parse(q))`.
  - **Migration** for anyone constructing AST literals (after 0.14's `receiver` → `destinations`): add `kind` to `Query`/`Subquery`/`Follow`/`OrderSpec`, `span` to every node, write the materialized fields (`limit: null`, `countCmp: null`, `distinct: false`, `values: false`), drop `index`; or use `build.*`. Rust: struct variants gained `span` (match with `..`), `Expr::Lit(v)` is `Expr::Lit { value, span }`, `Token` gained `end`.
  - **omgbase** (`@omgbase/core`, `omgbase-surface`): the runner's `$self` row-function rewrite is a `transform`, the `semantic("…")` scan a `visit`, aliases are resolved once before the runner's own rewrites; the `graph` macro builds its `follow` walk with the builders and `print`s it instead of splicing strings — the generated query text and every `spec/surface` result are unchanged. `@omgbase/oqx-syntax`'s `LANGUAGE_VERSION` moves to `0.16` (assets regenerated).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-09

### Patch
- OQX language **0.15**: the intrinsic naming the current item is **`$it`**; `$value` is no longer an intrinsic and has no synonym. `$it` is the scope's row itself — the top-level row, a nested block's inner item, each element of a scalar collection, the entry's value inside `entries(x)` — absent at the root, with `^$it` the enclosing row, `$it.field` navigation, `$it values`, `$it` as a `follow … { by $it }` identity. A row property literally named `$it` is shadowed by the intrinsic. `$value` is now an ordinary property name under SEMANTICS §2 step 5, exactly like the non-metadata `$` names since 0.13: `{ "$value": 3 }` projects `3`, a row without one reads absent, over scalars it is absent, and inside an `entries()` scope it is a property of the entry's *value*. Why: "self" implies a fixed referent while the row changes per scope; "it" is the pronoun for whatever is being handled; keeping `$value` as a synonym would spell one concept two ways. `$key` is unchanged, and the `{ key, value }` record of `entries(x)` used as a plain value is unchanged (that is a value shape, not the intrinsic). **Migration:** replace `$value` with `$it` in every query (`s/\$value/\$it/g`); nothing else moves. New `intrinsics` fixtures pin the rule; every other fixture query was rewritten with its expectation untouched. omgbase's query surface (`query`, `query_syntax`, the CLI help, `docs/query-language.md`, the tutorial, `spec/surface` fixture queries) follows: a `$value` in an omgbase query now reads a frontmatter/attrs key so named.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-06

### Patch
- OQX language **0.14** (`spec/oqx/VERSION`): `follow` gains correlated successor
  predicates and destination lists.

  - **`^` in the follow `where` is the frontier row.** `follow R { where P }` now
    reads `P` in the candidate's scope whose parent is the row being expanded, so
    `follow doc.in { where before.contains(^$path) }` steps only into rows that
    name the row they were reached from; `^^name` is the walk's enclosing scope.
    Before, `^` skipped the frontier row and read the enclosing scope (the root
    for a top-level walk), so a correlated predicate silently never held.
    `frontier` and `by` are unchanged (`^` there is the enclosing scope).
  - **Destination lists.** `follow a, b, …` walks the union of several
    destinations; each is a relation of the current row or a **destination
    block** — a select-position `collect`/`first`/`single` block re-evaluated per
    frontier row with `^` bound to it (`follow ^people collect { where manager ==
    ^id }`, `follow before, ^docs collect { where after.contains(^$path) }`).
    Within one expansion step the successors are unioned by identity — the
    walk's identity, so `by E` governs it: a relation holding a node twice now
    yields one successor, and under `by type` same-type siblings reached in one
    step are one node (the surface case `query-follow::by-rekeys-identity` goes
    from 8 to 5 hits). `frontier`, `depth`, `where`
    and `by` apply to the whole walk; `$ordinal` stays `(depth, path)`.
  - AST: `Follow.receiver` becomes `Follow.destinations` (TypeScript
    `(Expr | OpNode)[]`; Rust `Vec<FollowDestination>` with `Relation(Expr)` /
    `Block(OpNode)`). omgbase's query rewriters and planners read the new shape;
    `@omgbase/oqx-syntax` pins `LANGUAGE_VERSION` to `0.14`.
  - 27 new fixtures in `spec/oqx/cases/follow.json` (877 cases in 29 files).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Minor
- New package **`@omgbase/oqx-syntax`**: syntax highlighting assets for OQX, generated from one lexical vocabulary so no editor grammar can drift from another. It ships the TextMate grammar (`source.oqx`, `syntax/oqx.tmLanguage.json`), a Monaco Monarch grammar (`syntax/oqx.monarch.json`), a CodeMirror 6 stream parser (`oqxStreamParser(tags)`, plus `oqxLegacyMode()` in CodeMirror 5's shape for Obsidian), a Prism grammar (`oqxPrismGrammar`, `registerOqxPrism`), the editor language configuration, language metadata (`LANGUAGE`, `LANGUAGE_VERSION`), the vocabulary itself (keywords, contextual words, consumers, builtins, intrinsics, the omgbase host names), and adapters for Shiki (`oqxShikiLanguage`), Monaco (`registerOqx`) and a VS Code extension under `vscode/` that also highlights ```` ```oqx ```` Markdown fences. Highlighting is lexical: contextual words are colored only in position (`count {`, `limit 10`, `order by`, `in <value>`), malformed numbers and lex-error characters are marked `invalid`, and every `$name` is an intrinsic. Tests tokenize with the real TextMate engine (golden corpus), prove that the Monarch, CodeMirror and Prism grammars tokenize every `spec/oqx` fixture exactly as TextMate does, check that lexically valid fixtures never show an error token, pin the vocabulary to the spec prose and to `@omgbase/oqx`'s `LANGUAGE_VERSION`, and load the grammar into Shiki.
