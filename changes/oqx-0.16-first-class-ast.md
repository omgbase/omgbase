**OQX 0.16 — the AST is a first-class contract** (`spec/oqx/AST.md`, fixtures `cases/ast.json` + `cases/ast-spans.json`, 70 new cases; 959 in all). Both engines now produce one normalized tree a tool can reflect on without re-parsing:

- **Spans on every node**: `span: [start, end)` in Unicode code points over the raw source (a template's `rawSource`, where a binding occupies its `${n}` marker). The TypeScript lexer counted UTF-16 units; it now counts code points like the Rust one, so the `(at offset N)` of a lex/parse error is the same number in both engines. `toUtf16(span, source)` converts for editors.
- **Normalized shape**: `kind` on every node (`query`, `subquery`, `follow`, `order` added), optionals materialized (`where`/`limit`/`offset`/`countCmp: null`, `distinct`/`values: false`), operators and consumers serialized as their source words, the never-produced `Expr.index` variant removed. `toJSON(query)` / `ast_to_json(&query)` emit `{ "oqx": "0.16", "kind": "query", … }`; the Rust crate derives serde under the `json` feature (`query_from_json` reads it back).
- **`where` keeps its surface form**: the parser no longer inlines `select` aliases into `where` (it only validates them — every `errors-parse` fixture is unchanged); the substitution is the exported pure `resolveAliases` / `resolve_aliases`, applied exactly once by the run entry points (`oqx`, `run`, `execute`, `runQuery`; `run_query`, `execute`). **An `Engine.run` now evaluates the query it is given** — code that drives `InMemoryEngine`/`PlannedEngine` directly with a query whose `where` uses aliases must resolve first (resolution is not idempotent: `name: name.upper() … where name`).
- **Traversal**: `visit(root, { enter, leave })` with `{ path, clause, depth }` (scope depth, 0 = root) and `transform(root, f)`, both driven by one child-key table (`CHILDREN`; Rust `walk::visit`/`transform` with a `Visitor` trait, `Node`, `Clause`); `stripSpans` / `strip_spans`; builders `build.*` / `oqx::build::*` for hand-made nodes (empty span `[0, 0]`).
- **Canonical printer**: `print(node)` / `print_query` — single spaces, `select` written at the top level, every item aliased, double-quoted strings, minimal parentheses from the precedence table; `printTemplate` → `{ strings, count, indices }` for a tree with bindings (`print` throws, new error stage `print`). Law, enforced by both spec runners over every fixture query: `strip(parse(print(parse(q)))) ≡ strip(parse(q))`.
- **Migration** for anyone constructing AST literals (after 0.14's `receiver` → `destinations`): add `kind` to `Query`/`Subquery`/`Follow`/`OrderSpec`, `span` to every node, write the materialized fields (`limit: null`, `countCmp: null`, `distinct: false`, `values: false`), drop `index`; or use `build.*`. Rust: struct variants gained `span` (match with `..`), `Expr::Lit(v)` is `Expr::Lit { value, span }`, `Token` gained `end`.
- **omgbase** (`@omgbase/core`, `omgbase-surface`): the runner's `$self` row-function rewrite is a `transform`, the `semantic("…")` scan a `visit`, aliases are resolved once before the runner's own rewrites; the `graph` macro builds its `follow` walk with the builders and `print`s it instead of splicing strings — the generated query text and every `spec/surface` result are unchanged. `@omgbase/oqx-syntax`'s `LANGUAGE_VERSION` moves to `0.16` (assets regenerated).
